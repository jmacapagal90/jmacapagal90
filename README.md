# James Macapagal
## About Me
I'm a former Business Analyst turned Software Engineer, skilled in React, Ruby on Rails, and SQL, with 5+ years working within Agile product teams. A recent grad of the Flatiron School Bootcamp, I learned vanilla JS (ES6), React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails all within 15 weeks, with each unit culminating in a technicall assessment and group project.  I know I can learn quickly and make an impact if given the opportunity. 

As far as me IRL, I'm a self-professed renaissance man :)  I do improv comedy, acting, and write sketch comedy in Chicago. My other hobbies include: cooking, gaming, my two cats, traveling with my wife, comic books, Chicago food scene, and Chicago sports (let's go Cubs!). 

I'm open to collaborating on projects, and I hope to enhance any team with both my professional and personal experiences.
